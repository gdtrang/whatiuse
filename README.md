# **What I use**
List of things I use 

I work as a software developer and I'm curious to see how this will change or not.

**Laptop**: MacBook Pro 15" 2019 (2.4 GHz Intel Core i9, Radeon Pro Vega 20 4 GB, 32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4 RAM). I chose the 15" model for the larger screen to work from as well as the video card to carry a single device.  I did find myself using the video card once to train a model more quickly then just using the CPU

**Dock**: CalDigit TS3 Plus Thunderbolt 3 Dock.  It allows me to have 2 external monitors into a single port in the macbook.  Additionally it has a NIC which is great since I prefer to not use wifi as I find the the smallest cut in audio disturbing. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZPV8DF
